# Introduction

This is a small script that I wrote for myself to keep track of all the yield mining pools I've participated in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

## Supported Protocols

Protocols will have to be integrated manually.

You can see the latest list of supported protocols under `ProtocolFactory.js`

## Running Instructions

1. Clone the entire repository into your local computer.
2. Make sure you have node installed.
3. Under the `src` folder, create a new file `secrets/secrets.js` and put in the BSC address you want to track. (TODO: this will be improved)
4. At root, run `node .`
