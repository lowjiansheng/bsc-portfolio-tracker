# Introduction

This is a small script that I wrote for myself to keep track of all the yield mining pools I've participated in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

## Supported Protocols

Protocols will have to be integrated manually.

You can see the latest list of supported protocols under `ProtocolFactory.js`

## Running Instructions

1. Clone the entire repository into your local computer.
2. Make sure you have node installed.
3. Modify the wallet address that you want to track at `src/secrets/secrets.js`
4. At root, run `node .`
